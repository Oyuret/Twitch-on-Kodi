Twitch on Kodi
==================

Watch your favorite gaming streams on Kodi.

FAQ
----------------

* I can't find the Twitch.tv add-on in the Kodi add-on manager!

> Make sure you are using at least Kodi 15 (Isengard), Kodi 16 (Jarvis).

* I'm having issues with the playback of streams (buffering, dropping, stuttering).

> This Addon does not handle any aspect of the playback of Twitch streams (that would be the Kodi Video Player), it simply tells Kodi what to play.
> The Addon does however provide Quality Options which may help if your internet connection / computer specs are below requirements for HD streams.
